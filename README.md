Because I don't want to pay Apple $100 a year just to distribute this utility
you have to set it up yourself if you want to use it.

To install:

1. Make sure 'Show Develop menu in menu bar' is enabled in Safari preferences.

2. Clone this extension from a terminal

        git clone https://github.com/theonlygusti/shift-to-select.git && open -a Finder shift-to-select

3. Open the Extension Builder, Develop > Show Extension Builder.

4. Add an extension.

5. Choose the one you cloned from GitHub, easiest by drag and dropping the folder from the Finder window that was opened earlier.

The only limitation I'm aware of, a result of me not wanting to waste $100 a year, is that
you have to reload the extension (from the Extensions Builder) every time you restart
Safari.
